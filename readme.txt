Description: An object oriented PHP framework for easily building Wordpress plugins and widgets.

== Description ==

= Create new plugins quickly =

This simple plugin development framework makes it super easy to create sophisticated custom plugins and widgets for Wordpress 2.9+.

Please be aware that this is just an empty framework: when installed "as-is", the plugin will not do anything.

It is just a base toolkit on which to build up actual features.

Compatible with PHP5.

This framework is used by all recent and upcoming [YD plugins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/profile/ydubois Wordpress Plugins by Yann Dubois). File versions should be consistent between all installed YD plugins.

= Active support =

Drop me a line on my [YD Recent Images plugin support site](http://www.yann.com/en/wp-plugins/yd-wordpress-plugins-framework "Yann Dubois' Wordpress Plugins Framework") to report bugs, ask for specific feature or improvement, or just tell me how you're using the framework.
It's still in an active development stage, with new features coming out on a regular basis.

== Installation ==

Wordpress automatic installation is fully supported and recommended.
Please be aware that the plugin does not have any actual feature implemented upon installation.
